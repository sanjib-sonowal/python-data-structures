# Python Data Structures
This repo consists of several programs related to data structures in Python.
# Sample Programs
## Recursion
Recursion is a key idea in data structures and computer science. It describes the method that a function uses to invoke itself during the course of its own execution. Recursive functions, then, are functions that solve problems by splitting them up into smaller, easier-to-manage subproblems of the same kind and then solving those subproblems by calling themselves. Up until a base case is achieved, each recursive call tackles a smaller amount of the issue before returning a solution.

When a problem can be broken down naturally into smaller instances of the same problem, recursion is frequently utilized to solve it. Given that many data structures, like trees and linked lists, exhibit recursive features, it is particularly prevalent in data structures and algorithms.

Key elements of recursion include:

Base Case: This is a condition that defines when the recursion should stop. It's the simplest instance of the problem that can be solved directly without further recursion.

Recursive Case: This is the part of the function where it calls itself with a modified version of the problem. It's where the problem is broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

Progress Toward Base Case: Each recursive call should make progress toward the base case, ensuring that the recursion eventually terminates.

Recursion is often used in various data structure operations and algorithms, such as:

Tree Traversal: Recursive algorithms are commonly used to traverse trees, like binary trees and binary search trees, by visiting each node in a systematic way.

Sorting Algorithms: Some sorting algorithms, such as quicksort and mergesort, are implemented using recursion to divide the array into smaller subarrays for sorting.

Search Algorithms: Recursive search algorithms, like binary search, divide the search space into smaller parts with each recursive call.

Mathematical Calculations: Recursion is used in mathematical calculations involving sequences and series, like the Fibonacci sequence or factorial calculations.

Graph Algorithms: Recursive algorithms can be used to explore and traverse graphs, especially in depth-first search (DFS).
